This was my first attempt at a fullstack MERN app. This app uses a stock API to fetch and store data about different stocks. Once the data is fetched from the API it is saved into a mongodb. From there you can delete each stock indvidually and/or delete all stocks. This application uses React on the frontend and express and mongo on the backend
